## Features

### [Squeezelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezelite)

Squeezelite comes embedded into the application. This allows you playing music to your computer. The player name will be the same as your computer name. You can change the name in Music Assistant settings. You can also toggle if you wish to enable squeezelite at all.

> [!INFO]
> Only on Windows:
>
> - There seems to be a layout issue with the sidebar on windows
> - Untill [this PR](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/994) gets merged and released the app runs the frontend openly on your computer on port 22863. The reason behind that is that webkit2 in windows dosnt allow connections to unsecured websockets if the app itself is secured with TLS..
